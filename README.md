# blender-wal
Pywal addon for Blender themes

  I'm indecisive and feel the need to change my wallpaper every five minutes, so it helps having some scripts that can automate applying a matching color palette to the stuff I use. Add to your wallpaper manager or just run it manually whenever you swap wallpapers- it should appear in blender under Preferences as Pywal Theme.

By virtue of the theme not using set colors and instead using whatever your wallpaper is, some themes will look better than others, but I've gotten some pretty nice ones.

# Usage Guide

**Install:**  `git clone https://github.com/Ctoagn1/blender-wal`
Move the script and xml to a directory of your choosing- it should work, as long as they're together. chmod +x if necessary, and you should be good to go.

**Dependencies:**  Blender, python, and pywal. Which, if you're interested in using this, you probably already have.

**Features:** You can pass `-a` or `--axis` as an argument to the script in order to change the xyz-axes. It's off by default, as I didn't want to make it too intrusive.
