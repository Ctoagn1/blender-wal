Pywal addon for Blender themes

  I'm indecisive and feel the need to change my wallpaper every five minutes, so it helps having some scripts that can automate applying a matching color palette to the stuff I use. Add to your wallpaper manager or just run it manually whenever you swap wallpapers- it should appear in blender under Preferences as Pywal Theme.

By virtue of the theme not using set colors and instead using whatever your wallpaper is, some themes will look better than others, but I've gotten some pretty good looking ones out of it.
